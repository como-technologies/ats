# Introduction

This project explores the state-of-the-art of AI-driven software development, with a focus on how **Agents**, **Tools**, and **Skills** can work together to enable more sophisticated development workflows.

## The Vision

Rather than thinking of AI as a simple code completion tool, we're exploring how AI can function as a "digital software team" - with specialized roles, knowledge boundaries, and coordination patterns that mirror how real development teams work.

## Key Questions

We're investigating several fundamental questions:

1. **Role Granularity**: How should responsibilities be divided? Is one "Backend Developer" agent better than separate "Database Designer" + "API Developer" + "Business Logic" agents?

2. **Knowledge Boundaries**: Where do skills end and agents begin? Should security be a cross-cutting concern (skill) or a specialized agent?

3. **Coordination Patterns**: How should different roles communicate and hand off work? What are the trade-offs between sequential, parallel, and collaborative approaches?

4. **Optimization**: Can we use data (metrics on efficiency, quality, context usage, etc.) to iterate on role definitions and find optimal team structures?

5. **Full-Stack Development**: How does this extend beyond code to infrastructure, containerization (LXD), networking, security, migrations, and DevOps practices?

## Approach

We'll build a real multi-service system with proper infrastructure, using the development process itself as an experiment. Along the way, we'll:

- Map development roles to SWEBOK knowledge areas
- Instrument the process to gather metrics
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Iterate on role definitions based on empirical data
